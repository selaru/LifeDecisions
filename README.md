**Warning** 
> :warning: **Caution:** Attempting to make this 'LifeDecisions' repository public may result in an unexpected privacy breach, causing a sudden influx of 'I told you so' issues from relatives and 'Why weren't we invited to the beta testing?' pull requests from friends. Keep this repo private to avoid accidentally committing your secret salsa recipe or exposing your 'learning-to-dance' branch. Remember, some updates are best kept under wraps, like superhero identities and your midnight snack habits. Stay safe, code privately, and let's keep our digital diary under lock and keyâ€”because no one needs to know about the 'Karaoke Practice' commits.
